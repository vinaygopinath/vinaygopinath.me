I spent some time over the weekend experimenting with [voice2json](https://voice2json.org/) and [rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), trying to set up a fully offline voice assistant system using [Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) for speech recognition, a template file containing all known phrases and their mappings to intents, an intent recognizer and a local shell script to parse the recognized intent and invoke commands (think opening a website or folder when an intent is recognized). Rhasspy was easy to use and really fun. It's amazing how far we've come in terms of open-source tools in the TTS/speech recognition space.

Along the way, I discovered [Larynx](https://github.com/rhasspy/larynx), a TTS system for Linux with high-quality voices from [Glow-TTS](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/glow-tts) and others, with intonations that sound human. I've kept an eye on the [Linux TTS](https://askubuntu.com/questions/53896/natural-sounding-text-to-speech) space for years and have been disappointed by the limited consumer-use options. Often, the pre-trained TTS voices sound all too robotic for everyday use. I suppose that's understandable given the dearth of open-source voice datasets (which is why projects like [Mozilla CommonVoice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org) are so exciting!). It's nice to have a pleasant pre-trained TTS model natively available on Linux.

My use case is to copy text in a browser/Thunderbird RSS article, hit a shortcut and have the TTS system read the selected text aloud so I can look away from the screen and just listen.

## Setup
I followed the [Debian installation instructions](https://github.com/rhasspy/larynx#debian-installation), and downloaded and installed the `tts`, `lang-en_us` and `Harvard Glow TTS` files.
```shell
# cd Downloads # (or /path/to/downloaded/deb/files)
sudo apt install ./larynx*.deb
```

## TTS Shortcut
To create a shortcut that invokes Larynx on selected text, I added aliases in my `~/.bash_aliases` file. They use `xclip` to access clipboard and selection data. On Debian-based systems, you should be able to install it with `sudo apt install xclip`.
```shell
# Speak text passed as argument
# Usage: speak "This is a test"
alias speak="larynx --voice harvard-glow_tts --interactive"

# Speak clipboard text
# Usage: speak-clipboard
alias speak-clipboard="xclip -out -selection clipboard | speak"

# Speak currently selected text
# Usage: speak-selection
alias speak-selection="xclip -out -selection primary | speak"
```

Under Settings --> Keyboard on GNOME, I added a custom keybinding for Super+S to invoke `bash -i -c "speak-selection"`. This lets me select any text and hit Super+S to invoke larynx
