### Hi, I’m Vinay

I’ve been hooked on writing code ever since I wrote a *Who wants to be a millionaire?/Kaun Banega Crorepati* clone in QBasic as a nerdy 11 year old. During my university years, I tinkered with Android, an emerging platform at the time (2009!), and worked as an Android developer at a startup in my “hometown”, Bangalore.

Around the time, I caught the travel bug, which took me to Omsk, Russia as a volunteer English teacher. I discovered the term “digital nomad” just as I began to take freelance + remote frontend/full-stack web jobs and tried my hand as a farmer in the Negev desert in Israel, travelled across Sri Lanka, hosted lots of Couchsurfers in Pokhara, Nepal, volunteered at [Payir](http://payir.org), in a remote village in Tamil Nadu, and moved seven times in two years within Poland with a single suitcase of belongings.

In recent years, thanks in large part to my time among the dedicated folks at Payir, I’ve come to terms with the privilege I enjoy as a middle-class, urban, tech worker and I'm trying to put it to use for underprivileged communities by working in a tech role for a social enterprise or non-profit addressing rural empowerment, poverty alleviation, or access to healthcare, education or employment opportunities.
