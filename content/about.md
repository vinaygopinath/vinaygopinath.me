### Hi, I'm Vinay

I first discovered writing code at age 11 thanks to a school program. I started off with HTML and QBasic, and building a text-based clone of _Kaun Banega Crorepati/Who wants to be a millionaire?_ on my own (with a lot of GOTO statements ðŸ˜…) gave me a huge rush. Over the years, I've had full-stack and mobile engineer roles at several startups and contractor positions as a digital nomad, interspersed with organic farming in Israel, teaching English in Omsk, Russia, and a stint as a tech volunteer at [Payir](https://payir.org) in Tamil Nadu, India.

Thanks in large part to my time among the dedicated folks at Payir, I've come to recognise the privilege I enjoy as a cis-gendered, middle-class, English-speaking, urban tech worker, and I'm trying to put my skills to use for underprivileged communities. I'm interested in the intersection of technology and social change in the form of improved healthcare, access to education, addressing climate change, rights awareness, community building, and civic action. At present, I am the Android team lead at [Maisha Meds](https://maishameds.org/).

Talk to me about
* LGBTQ rights and services
* Slow travel and cycling
* Climate change, climate inequality and renewable energy
* Ecological farming
* Mental health initiatives
* Minimalism and anti-consumption
* Eurocentrism, internationalization and regional language support
* Sexual violence, gender roles and gender equality
* Religiosity and social philosophy

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss a project or idea, or just to say hi! I'm available at `vinay @ domain name`.
